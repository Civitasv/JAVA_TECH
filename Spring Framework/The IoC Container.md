# 1. The IoC Container

> This chapter covers Spring's Inversion of Control (Ioc) container.

## 1.1 Introduction to the Spring IoC Container and Beans

IoC is also known as dependency injection. It is a process whereby objects define their dependencies (that is, the other objects they work with) only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method. The container then injects those dependencies when it creates the bean. This process is fundamentally the inverse (hence the name, Inversion of Control) of the bean itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies by using direct construction of classes or a mechanism such as the Service Locator pattern.

`BeanFactory`: provide an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing any type of object.

`beans`: the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container.

Beans, and the dependencies among them, are reflected in the configuration metadata used by a container.

## 1.2 Container Overview

The `org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext` interface represents the Spring IoC container and is reponsible for instanitaing, configuring, and assembling the beans.

The following diagram shows a high-level view of how Spring works. Your application classes are combined with configuration metadata so that, after the `ApplicationContext` is created and initialized, you have a fully configured and executable system or application.

### 1.2.1 Configuration Metadata

This configuration metadata represents how you, as an application developer, tell the Spring container to instantiate, configure, and assemble the objects in your application. Spring configuration consists of at least one and typically more than one bean definition that the container must manage. XML-based configuration metadata configures these beans as `<bean/>` elements inside a top-level `<beans/>` element. Java configuration typically uses `@Bean`-annotated methods within a `@Configuration` class.

An example of the basic structure of XML-based configuration metadata:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="..." class="...">  
        <!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <bean id="..." class="...">
        <!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <!-- more bean definitions go here -->

</beans>
```

1. `id` attribute is a string that identifies the individual bean definition.
2. `class` attribute defines the type of the bean and uses the fully qualified classname.

### 1.2.2 Instantiating a Container

The `ApplicationContext` class is initiate by resource strings.

```java
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("services.xml", "daos.xml");
```

The `services.xml` as follows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <!-- services -->

    <bean id="petStore" class="org.springframework.samples.jpetstore.services.PetStoreServiceImpl">
        <property name="accountDao" ref="accountDao"/>
        <property name="itemDao" ref="itemDao"/>
        <!-- additional collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <!-- more bean definitions for services go here -->

</beans>
```

And the `daos.xml` is:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="accountDao"
        class="org.springframework.samples.jpetstore.dao.jpa.JpaAccountDao">
        <!-- additional collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <bean id="itemDao" class="org.springframework.samples.jpetstore.dao.jpa.JpaItemDao">
        <!-- additional collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <!-- more bean definitions for data access objects go here -->
```

From these two files, we can see that the `petStore` has two `property`, one `accountDao`, another `itemDao`, which are defined in `daos.xml`. By this way, we can express the dependency between collaborating objects.

#### Composing XML-based Configuration Metadata

It can be useful to have bean definitions span multiple XML files. Often, each individual XML configuration file represents a logical layer or module in program architecture.

We can use the constructor of `ApplicationContext` to realize it, and we can also use one or more occurrences of the `<import/>` elements to load bean definitions from another file or files. For example:

```xml
<beans>
    <import resource="services.xml"/>
    <import resource="resources/messageSource.xml"/>
    <import resource="/resources/themeSource.xml"/>

    <bean id="bean1" class="..."/>
    <bean id="bean2" class="..."/>
</beans>
```

In this example, this XML definitions are loaded from three files: `services.xml`, `messageSource.xml` and `themeSource.xml`.

NOT RECOMMENDED: USE RELATIVE PATH.

The namespace itself provides the import directive feature. Further configuration features beyond plain bean definitions are avaliable in a selection of XML namespaces provided by Spring -- for example, the `context` and `util` namespaces.

### 1.2.3 Using the Container

The `ApplicationContext` is the interface for an advanced factory capable of maintaining a registry of different beans and their dependencies. By using the method `T getBean(String name, Class<T> requiredType)`, you can retrieve instances of your beans.

```java
// create and configure beans
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("services.xml", "daos.xml");

// retrieve configured instance
PetStoreService service = context.getBean("petStore", PetStoreService.class);

// use configured instance
List<String> userList = service.getUsernameList();
```

We can also use the class `GenericApplicationContext`, for example:

```java
GenericApplicationContext context = new GenericApplicationContext();
new XmlBeanDefinitionReader(context).loadBeanDefinitions("services.xml", "daos.xml");
context.refresh();
```

Once we get context, we can use `getBean` to retrieve instances of your beans. The `ApplicationContext` interface has a few other methods for retrieving beans, but, ideally, your application code should never use them. Indeed, your application code should have no calls to the getBean() method at all and thus have no dependency on Spring APIs at all. For example, Springâ€™s integration with web frameworks provides dependency injection for various web framework components such as controllers and JSF-managed beans, letting you declare a dependency on a specific bean through metadata (such as an autowiring annotation).
